Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a key economic indicator that measures the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific period, typically a year or a quarter. It serves as a comprehensive scorecard of a nation's economic activity and health.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three primary approaches to calculating GDP:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Production (or Output) Approach:**  \n",
      "   This method sums the value added at each stage of production across all industries. It considers the total value of goods and services produced minus the value of intermediate goods used in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Income Approach:**  \n",
      "   This approach sums all incomes earned by individuals and businesses in the country, including wages, profits, rents, and taxes minus subsidies. It reflects the distribution of income generated by economic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expenditure Approach:**  \n",
      "   The most common method, it calculates GDP by adding up all expenditures on final goods and services. The formula is:  \n",
      "   **GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + (Exports - Imports)**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Points about GDP:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Nominal vs. Real GDP:**  \n",
      "  - *Nominal GDP* measures the value using current prices, which can be affected by inflation.  \n",
      "  - *Real GDP* adjusts for inflation, providing a more accurate comparison over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **GDP per Capita:**  \n",
      "  Dividing GDP by the population gives GDP per capita, an indicator of the average economic output per person, often used to compare living standards across countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Limitations:**  \n",
      "  While GDP is a useful indicator of economic activity, it doesn't account for income distribution, environmental sustainability, or unpaid work. Therefore, it should be considered alongside other measures for a comprehensive understanding of economic well-being.\n",
      "\n",
